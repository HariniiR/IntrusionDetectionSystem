# Intrusion Detection System using a Neural Network (Built from Scratch)

This project implements an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using a **neural network built entirely from scratch** in Python with **NumPy**. It is trained to classify **network traffic data** as either **normal** or **anomalous** based on features from the popular **KDD Cup 1999 dataset**.

---

## Features

* Neural Network built from scratch (no frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch)
* Uses **forward propagation**, **backpropagation**, and **gradient descent**
* One-hot encoding of categorical data (`protocol_type`, `service`, `flag`)
* Min-max normalization for numerical features
* Binary classification: `normal (0)` vs `anomaly (1)`
* Accuracy tracking during training

---

##  Dataset

The model is trained and tested on a cleaned version of the **KDD Cup 1999** dataset.

>  Format:

```
duration, protocol_type, service, flag, src_bytes, dst_bytes, ..., class
```

>  Labels:

* `normal`: Normal network activity â†’ `0`
* `anomaly`: Any attack or suspicious behavior â†’ `1`
